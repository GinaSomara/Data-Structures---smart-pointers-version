This projects only contain linked lists. However, these programs are larger than the Java as I go into more detail within the functionality. I also added in several recursive functions to manipulate the elements in the linked list and also to present my understanding of recursive functions.
This project was especially fun because of the pointers! I created 2 versions, the first is with raw pointers.The second version was re-coded to change all the raw pointers into smart pointers. This can be found as another repository. 







!! The skeleton code of this is used from the below Pearson Education. However, I did all implementations/routing of the C++ files. The skeleton code merely gave the empty functions and empty classes to begin with. The skeleton code also provided the template for output.
